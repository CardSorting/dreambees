## Reporting a Vulnerability

At DreamBees, we take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@yourdomain.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and aim to respond with a detailed plan within 48 hours.

## Security Scope

Our security considerations cover:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Clerk authentication
   - Firebase custom tokens
   - Session management
   - Access control

2. **Data Security**
   - Firestore security rules
   - Data access patterns
   - Input validation
   - Output sanitization

3. **Infrastructure**
   - AWS services configuration
   - Firebase configuration
   - Network security
   - Resource access

## Supported Versions

We currently support security updates for:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

When working with our codebase:

### 1. Authentication
- Always verify Clerk sessions
- Use short-lived tokens
- Implement proper token refresh
- Validate all auth state changes

### 2. Firestore Rules
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Test all rule changes
- Document security assumptions
- Regular rule audits

### 3. Data Access
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Use prepared queries
- Implement rate limiting

### 4. Infrastructure
- Use secure configurations
- Regular security audits
- Monitor access logs
- Update dependencies

## Security Measures

We implement multiple layers of security:

1. **Application Level**
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention

2. **Authentication Level**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management
   - Token validation
   - Auth state monitoring

3. **Database Level**
   - Security rules
   - Data validation
   - Access control
   - Query validation

4. **Infrastructure Level**
   - Network security
   - Resource isolation
   - Access logging
   - Regular audits

## Vulnerability Response

When a vulnerability is reported:

1. **Initial Response** (24 hours)
   - Acknowledge receipt
   - Assign severity level
   - Begin investigation

2. **Assessment** (48 hours)
   - Validate vulnerability
   - Determine impact
   - Plan mitigation

3. **Resolution**
   - Develop fix
   - Test solution
   - Deploy to staging
   - Validate fix

4. **Disclosure**
   - Notify affected users
   - Document incident
   - Update security measures
   - Release post-mortem

## Security Updates

We provide security updates through:

1. **Critical Updates**
   - Immediate deployment
   - User notification
   - Forced client updates

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Monthly security patches
   - Dependency updates
   - Infrastructure updates

## Security Monitoring

We continuously monitor:

1. **Authentication**
   - Login attempts
   - Token usage
   - Session patterns
   - Auth failures

2. **Data Access**
   - Query patterns
   - Access logs
   - Error rates
   - Usage anomalies

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Resource usage
   - Network traffic
   - API calls
   - Error logs

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Report vulnerability
2. Allow time for fix
3. Validate solution
4. Public disclosure

## Bug Bounty Program

We maintain a bug bounty program:

1. **Scope**
   - Authentication bypass
   - Data exposure
   - Access control
   - Infrastructure

2. **Rewards**
   - Critical: $5,000
